Working with images is a common task for many developers. Whether it's for a website, a mobile app, or a desktop application, images are a part of our lives.

But when it comes to image, resizing is almost mandatory. To improve user experience, we need to load images at the best size. And not a full size image in 4k.

The problem is that image resizing is not free. And when we search online for it, we can only find paid services. It's good because they have a lot of features around it. But it's not good for our wallet. And if we only need to resize an image, we don't need all those features.

## IPX is the solution

The solution is not free but it's very cheap. I'm talking about a simple VPS and an express server with [IPX](https://github.com/unjs/ipx).

The code is pretty simple:

```ts
import express from 'express';
import {
  createIPX,
  ipxFSStorage,
  ipxHttpStorage,
  createIPXNodeServer,
} from 'ipx';

const ipx = createIPX({
  storage: ipxFSStorage({
    dir: './public',
  }),
  httpStorage: ipxHttpStorage({
    domains: ['cdn.example.com'], // Domains that is authorized to resize images
  }),
});

express().use(createIPXNodeServer(ipx)).listen(8080);
```

Then when you host this service, use your CDN of choice, and each request will be saved on the CDN. And setup something like `img.example.com` to use this URI for the service.

Now that everything is setup, you can resize your image with the following URI:

```
https://img.example.com/width_200,format_webp/https://cdn.example.com/image.jpg
```

And with this url, you'll have an image resized with the same aspect ratio with a width of 200px, in webp format, and saved on the CDN cache.

For more information about all modifiers, you can read the [IPX documentation](https://github.com/unjs/ipx?tab=readme-ov-file#modifiers).
