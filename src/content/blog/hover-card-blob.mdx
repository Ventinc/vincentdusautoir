import { GithubCard } from '#/components/examples/github-card/result';
import { GithubCardDesign } from '#/components/examples/github-card/design';
import ComponentExample from '#/components/component-example.astro';

Yesterday, I saw the new landing page of [Github](https://github.com) and on this page there are this amazing cards that on `:hover` display a blob in the background. And I think it's a good think to make this a challenge for me to copy this effect in maximum one hour and documenting it here.

_For this challenge I'll use **React** and **TailwindCSS**. But it's the same
thing to make it with html, css and js._

Below is what we want to have in the end. To have a better experience, go on a regular browser, not a mobile one.

<ComponentExample>
  <GithubCard client:load />
</ComponentExample>

## Create and Style the component

So the first thing I need to do is just the simple architecture of the Card. I've just add ids for to explain what is each part of the card.

```tsx
const Card;
React.FC<{ children?: ReactNode }> = () => {
  return (
    <div id="card">
      <div id="blob" />
      <div id="inner">{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Then I need to add the style of the card and the blob with **TailwindCSS**

```tsx
export const Card: React.FC<{ children?: ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div
      id="card"
      className="relative z-auto block overflow-hidden rounded-xl bg-zinc-100 p-1 dark:bg-zinc-700"
    >
      <div
        id="blob"
        className="absolute left-0 top-0 h-24 w-24 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-green-500 blur-lg"
      />
      <div
        id="inner"
        className="relative h-full w-full rounded-lg bg-white/75 p-8 dark:bg-zinc-900/75"
      >
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

_On the blob I've added `-translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2` to set the top and
left position to be the center of it._

Here is the result we have now:

<ComponentExample
  title="Github Card Design"
>
  <GithubCardDesign client:load />
  <div slot="code">
    ```tsx file=<rootDir>/components/examples/github-card/design.tsx // Auto load
    ```
  </div>
</ComponentExample>

Now that this is complete we only need to add hover effect and animation on the `#card` and `#blob` components of the card.

## Animate the blob and the card

First thing I want to animate the blob, it need to follow the cursor and maybe add some delay. For that we need to listen on `#card` if `mouseenter`, `mousemove` and `mouseleave`.

- In `mouseenter`: Set the opacity of the blob to 100%.
- In `mousemove`: Set the position of the blob to the mouse position
- In `mouseleave`: Set the opacity of the blob to 0%.

```tsx
const Card = () => {
  const [blobVisible, setBlobVisible] = useState(false);
  const [blobPos, setBlobPos] = useState(false);

  const onMouseEnter = () => {
    setBlobVisible(true);
  };
  const onMouseMove = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
    const rect = e.currentTarget.getBoundingClientRect();
    const ev = e.nativeEvent;
    const newPos = {
      x: ev.clientX - rect.left,
      y: ev.clientY - rect.top,
    };

    setBlobPos(newPos);
  };
  const onMouseLeave = () => {
    setBlobVisible(false);
  };

  <div
    onMouseMove={onMouseMove}
    onMouseEnter={onMouseEnter}
    onMouseLeave={onMouseLeave}
    id="card"
  >
    <div id="blob" style={{ top: blobPos.y, left: blobPos.x }} />
    //...
  </div>;
};
```

Now that the blob move and follow the cursor, I can add transitions with TailwindCSS to move the blob smoothly and link the `blobVisible` variable with the opacity.

```tsx
<div
  id="blob"
  className={`... transition-all duration-75 ease-linear ${
    blobVisible ? 'opacity-100' : 'opacity-0'
  }`}
/>
```

The blob appear, disappear and move. I can add small rotation on the `#card` when I move on X Axis with the cursor. To do that I need to compute the percentage from the center of the `#card` on left and right in the `onMouseMove` function.

Here is the schema of what I want to have to compute the rotation on Y Axis.

![Compute Rotate Schema](#/assets/blog/hover-card-blob/compute-rotate.png)

To have the same value I need to offset the position of the cursor by half the width of `#card`.

```ts
const posX = newPos.x - rect.width / 2;
```

Then if I divide this result by `rect.width / 2` I obtain what I want, a percentage from -100% to 100% of the position X of the curson on the `#card`.

```ts
const percentage = (newPos.x - rect.width / 2) / (rect.width / 2);
```

Now that I have the percentage, it's pretty simple to animate the `#card`, I just need to multiply it with the value of the max rotation on Y Axis I want. At the end I've added this to the current code.

```tsx
const Card = () => {
  const [cardRotate, setCardRotate] = useState(0);

  //...
  const onMouseMove = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
    //...
    const percentage = (newPos.x - rect.width / 2) / (rect.width / 2);

    setCardRotate(-percentage * 10);
    //...
  };
  const onMouseLeave = () => {
    setCardRotate(0); // To reset the rotation on card leave
    //...
  };

  <div
    //...
    id="card"
    className="... origin-center transition-all duration-200 ease-linear"
    style={{
      transform: `perspective(200px) rotateY(${cardRotate}deg)`,
    }}
  >
    //...
  </div>;
};
```

And it's finish for this simple example of the Github Card hover effect.

## Result

_It's a very simple example, it will probably need a `ResizeObserver` to manage
the return value of `#card.getBoundingClientRect()` when the card resize._

<ComponentExample title="Github Card Result">
  <GithubCard client:load />
  <div slot="code">
    ```tsx file=<rootDir>/components/examples/github-card/result.tsx // Auto load
    ```
  </div>
</ComponentExample>
