I've been using all kind of services to deploy projects over the years. From AWS, to Vercel, to Heroku, Digital Ocean App Plaforms, etc.

And for each services it's either complicated to setup, expensive, or both.

So I've decided to try something that is here for a while but I never really used because I was scared of the learning curve.

I'm talking about **VPS**.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your local machine
- Knowing a bit of Docker and Docker Compose

## What is a VPS ?

A VPS is a virtual private server. It's a virtual machine that is created on a physical machine. It's like a small part of a computer that is created on a server.

## Why I wanted use a VPS and Docker ?

I wanted to use a VPS and Docker for my project because it's a lot cheaper than other services, easy to setup and manage. And there is no hidden fees that can be discovered after it's too late, for example high bills for traffic or storage.

And I wanted to learn how to use it. So I can deploy what I want, when I want, and how I want.

## How to setup a VPS ?

I've been using [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com)(Affiliate link) for all my VPS needs. It's a great service that is very easy to use. But you can use any other VPS provider you want.

### Step 1: Create a VPS

Create a VPS and personally I use ubuntu, but you can use any other OS. However this guide is for ubuntu.

### Step 2: Connect to your VPS

Connect to your VPS using SSH or account and password. As it was created.

```bash
ssh root@your_vps_ip
```

### Step 3: Create a new user

To not directly use the root user, we will create a new user. It's more secure and we will deactivate the root user.

```bash
adduser username # Create the user
usermod -aG sudo username # Add the user to the sudo group
su - username # Switch to the new user
sudo apt update # Update the package list and test that the user has sudo access
```

If it works, we can now add ssh key authentication to this user.

### Step 4: Setup SSH Key Authentication

On your local machine, generate a ssh key if you don't have one yet.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

This key will be in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.

Now we need to copy the SSH key to the new user on the server.

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub username@your_vps_ip
```

Now you should be able to connect to your VPS using the new user.

```bash
ssh username@your_vps_ip
```

### Step 5: Harden SSH configuration

The goal is to disable root login and password authentication. So we need to edit the SSH configuration file.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Modify the following parameters:

```bash
# Disable root login
PermitRootLogin no

# Disable password authentication
PasswordAuthentication no
```

Then restart SSH service.

```bash
sudo service ssh restart
```

**⚠️ Before login out, make sure that the new settings works.**

On another terminal, try to connect to your VPS using your username.

```bash
ssh username@your_vps_ip
```

If it works, you can now login out.

### Step 6: Set up a firewall (ufw)

UFW is a firewall that is very easy to use.

```bash
sudo apt install ufw
```

Allow SSH, HTTP and HTTPS.

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
```

Enable the firewall.

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

Checkout UFW status.

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

### Step 7: Install and Configure Fail2Ban (Optional)

This is optional, but it's a good way to protect your VPS from brute force authentication attemps.

```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban
```

Create a local configuration file.

```bash
sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Edit the configuration file.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

And ensure the following lines are set:

```ini
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = 22 ## Change this if you've modified your SSH port
maxretry = 5
bantime = 3600
```

Restart Fail2Ban service.

```bash
sudo service fail2ban restart
```

Checkout Fail2Ban status.

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client status
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

Now your VPS is more secure.

### Step 8: Add some SWAP to the VPS (Optional)
