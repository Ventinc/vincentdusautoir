I've been thinking a lot about simplicity lately.

I've realized that I complicate almost everything. From choosing a tech stack, a car, a job, a pen(even just deciding the color), or a meal at a restaurant(probably my biggest struggle).

For a long time, I believed that making the "perfect" choice was essential. I wanted control over every decision, thinking it would lead to better outcomes. But in reality, this constant overthinking only led to no actions, indecision, and less enjoyment.

## A shift in mindset

Recently, I found a better way: **keep it simple**.

Instead of chasing perfection or trying to optimize everything, I now focus on making quick decisions and sticking with them.

For example:

- Daily tasks: I replaced complex productivity apps like Notion and Reminders (on iPhone) with a simple notebook and pen that I carry everywhere.
- Ordering food: Before going to a restaurant, I decide what type of meal I want, then choose the first appealing option on the menu.
- Tech choices: I no longer chase the latest and greatest frameworks. Instead, I use what I know best and what gets the job done.

## Progress Over Perfection

Before, whenever I faced a problem, I would spend too much time searching for the best, most optimized solution. Now, I just build a simple solution that works. And improve it later.

This mindset shift has made my life easier and more enjoyable. I no longer feel the need to control everything. I just take action, keep things simple, and move forward.

## Final Thoughts

Simplicity isn't about settling for less; it's about focusing on what truly matters.

This realization has changed how I approach everything: simplify, decide, and move forward.
