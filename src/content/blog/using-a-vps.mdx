I've been using all kind of services to deploy projects over the years. From AWS, to Vercel, to Heroku, Digital Ocean App Plaforms, etc.

And for each services it's either complicated to setup, expensive, or both.

So I've decided to try something that is here for a while but I never really used because I was scared of the learning curve.

I'm talking about **VPS**.

## What is a VPS ?

A VPS is a virtual private server. It's a virtual machine that is created on a physical machine. It's like a small part of a computer that is created on a server.

## Why I wanted use a VPS ?

I wanted to use a VPS for my project because it's a lot cheaper than other services, easy to setup and manage. And there is no hidden fees that can be discovered after it's too late, for example high bills for traffic or storage.

And I wanted to learn how to use it. So I can deploy what I want, when I want, and how I want.

## How to setup a VPS ?

I've been using [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) for all my VPS needs. It's a great service that is very easy to use.
